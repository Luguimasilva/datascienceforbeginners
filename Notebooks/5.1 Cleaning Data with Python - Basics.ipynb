You can access each of these from the date_structure individually, as you can see below. If you want to know more, look at the datetime documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)... but for now, note how when you convert the year to 4 characters, you get '2048' (even though you might have been expecting '1948' here): yes, you too can introduce data errors if you're not careful!"
